                    wait_queue.append((current_task, time + n))

# ðŸ”¹ Why Is This Problem Solved This Way?
# The problem is about scheduling tasks efficiently while respecting the cooldown constraint.

# We solve it using Greedy + Heap + Queue because:

# Greedy Choice: Always schedule the most frequent task first.
# Heap (Priority Queue): Helps efficiently pick the most frequent task.
# Queue (Cooldown Management): Ensures tasks respect the n cooldown rule.
